 1.	@emotion/react
The @emotion/react package requires React and is recommended for users of that framework if possible.

Best when using React with a build environment that can be configured.

css prop support

Similar to the style prop, but also has support for auto vendor-prefixing, nested selectors, and media queries.

Allows developers to skip the styled API abstraction and style components and elements directly.

The css prop also accepts a function that is called with your theme as an argument allowing developers easy access to common and customizable values.

Reduces boilerplate when composing components and styled with emotion.

Server side rendering with zero configuration.

Theming works out of the box.

ESLint plugins available to ensure proper patterns and configuration are set.

2.	react-router-dom
React Router is a popular standard library for routing among various view components in React applications. It helps keep the user interface in sync with the URL. In addition, React Router allows defining which view to display for a specified URL.
The primary functionality of react-router-dom is implementing dynamic routing in web applications. Based on the platform and the requirements of the application, react-router-dom supports component-based routing, which is the ideal solution for routing if the React application is running on the browser.
